      "\n",
      "Question: How does the company expect gross margin to change in Q2 and the full year compared to 2022?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Did Gap Inc. pay a dividend in the first quarter, and what is their dividend strategy going forward?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: According to the text, Gap Inc. paid a first-quarter dividend of $0.15 per share, totaling $55 million. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a second-quarter fiscal 2023 dividend of $0.15 per share. This suggests that Gap Inc. has a quarterly dividend strategy in place, with a consistent payout amount of $0.15 per share.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, we can infer some information from the statements made by Bob Martin, Executive Chairman and Interim CEO, Gap Inc.
